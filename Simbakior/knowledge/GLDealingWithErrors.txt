When a GL error occured, gl will set a flag that can be retreived to see info about the error.
GL will stack errors as they occured so we might need to call glGetError() in a loop to clear errors before we try the part
we suspect in the code that is problematic, so we could call glGetError() after that part and get the relevant info.
For example: while (glGetError() != GL_NO_ERROR);

From OpenGL version 4.3 and up, a new method was added which tells the gl to call one of our methods when an error occured.
That way, we do not need to guess etc
