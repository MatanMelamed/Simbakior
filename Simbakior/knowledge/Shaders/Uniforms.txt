Uniforms are ways to get data from CPU to GPU - from  cpp file to a shader program.
Note - uniforms can be set once per draw, you cannot set the same uniform differently for different objects in the same draw,
I.e. you cannot set two triangles to different colors using uniforms.

To set a uniform, first declare it in a shader:
	uniform vec4 u_Color;
Then retreive it's location in the cpp file:
	...
	glUseProgram(shader);

	int location = glGetUniformLocation(shader, "u_Color");
You should check if it did not fail (value will be -1):
	ASSERT(location != -1);

Finaly, set the uniform data:
	glUniform4f(location, 1, 0.3, 0.8, 1);
