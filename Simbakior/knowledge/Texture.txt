OpenGL requires us to set parameters for textures, a texture without these will be rendered as black.

The textures parameters are:
GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER - how to sample image when it needs to be scaled down
GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER - how to sample image when it needs to be scaled up
GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S - how to wrap the texture x axis
GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T - how to wrap the texture y axis

internal format - how gl stores image
format - how the image is stored
